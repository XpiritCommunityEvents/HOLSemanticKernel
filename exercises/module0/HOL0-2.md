# Lab 0.2 - Preparing your machine
In this lab you are going to prepare an environment for this workshop. 

The labs are designed to be run in your browser, using GitHub Codespaces. We run the workshop in a GitHub enterprise that allows you to run this on our cost. We have preconfigured Codespaces for you with all the required tools and extensions installed. We highly recommend you use Codespaces to run the labs.

# Running from GitHub Codespaces
You can use GitHub Codespaces to run your development machine from the cloud. This way you do not have to setup anything on your development machine other than a modern browser. 

Go to https://github.com/XpiritCommunityEvents/HOLSemanticKernel/ to find the repository for the Semantic Kernel workshop.

On this page you should find a drop down with '<> Code' on it. Select the Codespaces tab and create a new codespace by pressing the Create button.

If you want more control over the options you can open the menu by clicking the elipsis at the right of the dialog. Choose `New with options...` from the menu.

A new dialog appears that allows you to specify details of your codespace.

Select "4-core, 8GB RAM" from the last option `Machine type` and change the region to be near to your location if needed. Click `Create codespace` to start the creation of your private development environment in the cloud.

Alternatively you can select one of the existing codespaces if you happen to return and continue work on a previous codespace session. 
You can get to manage your codespaces in more detail by following the link to `Manage All` in the first screenshot.

You can also remove instances, change the machine type later or export changes inside the codespace to a branch.

The Codespace will have all the extensions and tooling you need preinstalled.

# Running from  VSCode on your local development machine 
You can also choose to use your own Visual Studio Code environment to run the remote codespace. 

Visual Studio Code is available for all three platforms Windows, Linux and MacOS. Obtain Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/ and install it on your machine.

If you have installed Visual Studio Code, you can connect to your Codespace from there. Go to https://github.com/XpiritCommunityEvents/HOLSemanticKernel/ to find the repository for the Semantic Kernel workshop. in the same way as described in the previous section, create a new Codespace.
