# Lab 0.1 - Getting Started with the Semantic Kernel Workshop
In this lab you are going to setup your working environment for the Semantic Kernel workshop. We will start by provisioning a GitHub Repository for you with everyting you need to get started.

In this repo you will find all the labs source code for the workshop. Each lab is described in a separate markdown file. You can follow the instructions in these files to complete the labs.

## Creating the GitHub repository

- In the list of available issue templates select the `Signup Participant`
- Add your name to the title and if you like also add some infomation about yourself in the description field.
- Click the `Create` button to create the issue.

Now the proctors will get the issue. Once they close the issue, our GitOps automation will create a repository for you based on the template repository. the GitHub user that you signed in with. 

Before you can access the repository you will need to accept the invote that has been sent to your GitHub Email address. Since the email might take a while, or ends up in your spam folder, you can also navigate to the [organization section](https://github.com/settings/organizations) of your GitHub settings. There you should see a pending invitation for the XpiritCommunityEvents organization. Accept the invitation to get access to your personal repository.
