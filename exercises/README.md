# Welcome to the workshop labs for "Unlock the Potential of AI in Your Applications with Semantic Kernel"

In these labs, you will learn the fundamentals of Semantic Kernel (SK) and how to use it to build AI-powered applications and intelligent agents in .NET and C#.

The lab uses an existing .NET-based web application, Globoticket, an online concert and event ticketing platform. The Globoticket website doesn’t use AI yet, but throughout the labs, you will augment it with Semantic Kernel, adding Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and autonomous agents that can interact with users in natural language.

During the workshop, you’ll explore how to connect SK with AI models that are hosted on GitHub (OpenAI, Antrophic etc.), integrate memory and plugins, and build AI agents that can work together. 

By the end of the day, you’ll have the Globoticket application powered by intelligent, context-aware AI agents.

All workshop lab materials can be found in this repository in the exercises folder. Each lab has its own folder with step-by-step instructions.
